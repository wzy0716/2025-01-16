git branches

- `git branch`: lists all your current branches. The one you are on will have a `*` and the colored green
- `git branch <NAME>`: this will create a branch `<NAME>` where HEAD is
- `git switch <NAME>`: moves over to the branch `<NAME>`
- `git log --oneline`: see where you are

- `git push origin b1`: pushes the b1 branch to remote
- similar command for pulling from the remote
